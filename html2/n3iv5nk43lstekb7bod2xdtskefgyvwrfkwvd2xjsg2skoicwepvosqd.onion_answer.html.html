<h2>What is difference between a cloned card and prepaid card?</h2>

<p>CLONED CARD is a card whose details have been copied using a dedicated device called “ATM Skimmer” or by hacking into credit card databases on the Internet. The card is associated with a person’s bank account

PREPAID CARD is a card that can be used anywhere that accept a visa or MasterCard but the difference is that it is a card that is not associated with any bank account and does not have any identification information and therefore its use is completely anonymous! The limit for cash withdrawals at ATMs is $ 1500 per day.</p>

 

<h2>Do you provide PIN?</h2>

<p>Yes, we do. All cards have magnetic stripe & chip with 4 Digit PIN Code</p>

 

<h2>Which countries do you ship?</h2>

<p>We can send cards to any country</p>

<p>2: Cell number (Not Necessary)</p>
<p>3: City</p>
<p>4: Country</p>
<p>5: Valid email for sending you MTCN info etc </p>


<h2>Why don’t you withdraw by yourself?</h2>

<p>Of course, we withdraw for ourselves. But we cannot cash much money in one small city, because it is dangerous. It is also very dangerous to cooperate with agents in other cities, because they can be the police. It is easier and safer for us to deal with the sale. We also believe in Bitcoin and hope to get rich with it.</p>


<h2>No message about the dispatch of the goods</h2>

<p>After payment, send the transaction number and your item to email.</p>
