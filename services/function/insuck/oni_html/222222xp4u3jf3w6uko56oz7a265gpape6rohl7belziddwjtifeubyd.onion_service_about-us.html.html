                    <p>

                        The existence of our group <strong>dates back to 2007</strong> when a group of <strong>5 young teenagers</strong> who were part of various hacker forums decided to work together offering hacker services publicly, so that anyone interested but without the necessary technical knowledge could hire them.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Those 5 young teenegers, who were simply looking for a way to earn extra money, were the cornerstone that led to the formation of a group that to this day, 17 years later, continues to exist Shadow Hackerstantly expShadow Hackerer the nameShadow Hackerrong>Shadow Hacker</strong>.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        We have been actively involved in I2P since 2007 and the Tor network since 2010 with experienced and expert hackers from around the world. By 2024, the organization will consist of 85 members, we are completely apolitical and only interested in money, each member specializes in a different area: email and social networks, telephony and communications, website and database servers, cryptography , and of course the hackers of tomorrow: those who are still trained and learned from us, and whose focus is currently on customer service and support. If you contact us they will answer all your questions.

                        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i> ¿Por qué contratar un hacker?

                    </h3>

                    <p>

                        Unfortunately, <strong>people have a misconception</strong> about hacking as an activity and about hackers as people. The cause of this is mainly the Hollywood movies, where they show hackers as people capable of doing anything in just a few seconds. These Hollywood hackers can empty bank accounts, interfere with FBI security cameras, and blow up a hydrogen bomb, all simultaneously while sipping whiskey and smoking a cigar. In real life <strong>this is not so</strong>. Hacking is not something that is done in a minute but it requires time, a calm work environment, and above all, silence and concentration.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Many people who come to us ask us for <i>"a hacking software"</i> or <i>"to teach them how to do it"</i>. This is another misconception. There is <strong>no magic hacking software or app</strong>. It is not as easy as downloading a file and pressing a couple of buttons. There is also no step-by-step guide to hacking. This is not a cookery recipe (with all due respect to professional chefs). Hacking is like any other professional activity in the world. It may be unknown to many people, it may generate curiosity, or it may have been transformed into something mystical by movies, but it is a profession that is studied and learned for years.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        The question of: Why hire a hacker?, is the same as saying: Why should I go to the doctor ?, Why hire a lawyer ?, Why do I need an architect?<br>
                        If you feel bad or sick, it is normal to go to a doctor, as you need medical attention.<br>
                        If you have a question or legal problem, you should go to a lawyer, as they will answer your questions and take your case.<br>
                        If you want to build a house, you'll need an architect.<br>
                        Well, what if you want a hacking service? Bingo! <strong>You need a hacker</strong>.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        We are sorry to disappoint many people who perhaps believe that hacking is something simple that can be learned in a few minutes, or a day, or a week, or a month. Pretending this is the same as if we go to a hospital and ask the surgeon to tell us how to do a surgery because we want learn. The patient is likely to die if we do that, because we're not surgeons. In brief, <strong>you can't do it yourself</strong>. Hacking is something that you must study for years, practice and, of course, always keep up to date with new technologies. For this reason, you need to hire a hacker. Because if you have come this far, it must be because you need a service and we can offer you the best one, with the best quality and at the best price.
