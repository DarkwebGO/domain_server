                                    </p>

                                    <p>

                                        <strong class="inline-block">(1) Bitcoin Address.</strong> Your bitcoin address is something like your bank account number. If you must receive bitcoin from someone, you must tell them your bitcoin address. And also, as we have said before, anyone who knows your address, will be able to know how much money is inside it. However, as we also explained above, a bitcoin wallet is anonymous, no one will know who it belongs to, and it is disposable, which means you can use it only 1 time and throw it away and create a new one.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>

                                        <strong class="inline-block">(2) Private Key.</strong> It is something like a password. If someone wants to access the bitcoins in a wallet, they need the private key. Without the private key, the funds won't be accessible. For this reason, you should store it somewhere safe and not lose it.

                                    </p>
