As long as the technology is good enough, we can make money every day, Making thousands to tens of thousands of dollars every day is not a dream!.</TD></TR>

                <TD 
                  style="LINE-HEIGHT: 22px">¡¡Answer: As long as you can surf the Internet and type, you can learn. We have prepared a set of the most basic courses for new members.

                  style="LINE-HEIGHT: 22px">¡¡Answer: Of course, computer technology does not depend on the educational level of the household. Bill Gates became the richest man after dropping out of college. The president of Kingsoft did not start a business until he was 33 and learned programming. So as long as you are interested, you can definitely learn. Nothing is unachievable.</TD></TR>

                  style="LINE-HEIGHT: 22px">¡¡Answer: Basic English is used in programming, but as the saying goes, practice makes perfect. If you read the codes every day and memorize them, it will be like shopping for groceries every day. You don¡¯t need to look at the names of the dishes to know the approximate prices, so In fact, it has nothing to do with you having no foundation before.</TD></TR>
