If you have not paid yet, you'll have to add a fine of\n       <strong>\n        100 US Dollars\n       </strong>\n       to the value of the service. If we receive a payment without adding the fine, we won't deliver the order until having received the full value including the fine.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       Remember that after a delay, you won't be able to argue that you did not receive the proof that you received it late or that you had a problem. It is the\n       <strong>\n        responsibility of the client\n       </strong>\n       to contact us immediately if they notice that they have not received the proof after the maximum time indicated in the\n       <i>\n        \"Service Agreement\"\n       </i>\n       has passed, and it is also the responsibility of the client to prepare the payment before ordering and ensure that it can be made on time.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       The only Payment methods and transaction processs that we accept is\n       <strong>\n        <i class=\"fab fa-bitcoin\">\n        </i>\n        Bitcoin\n       </strong>\n       .\n       <br/>\n       If you have never used bitcoin before or don't know how it works, we highly recommend that you read our step-by-step guide now.
