Join a live online community of over 9,000 students and a course taught by industry experts. This course will take you from the absolute beginning, building your own hacking lab on your machine (like Kali Linux), all the way to becoming a security expert, able to use all the hacking techniques used by hackers and defend against them s attack Whether you are a complete beginner looking to become an hacker, or you are a student looking to learn about computer system security, or you are a programmer looking to improve their online security against hackers Attacks on your website, this course will take you deep into the world of hacking and penetration testing. We'll even teach you Python programming from scratch, for those who want to learn to program their own hacking and penetration testing tools. The focus of this course is on learning by doing. We'll teach you how hackers work by practicing the techniques and methods used by today's hackers. We'll start by setting up our hacking lab to make sure we keep your computer safe throughout the course, as well as doing things legally, and once our computers are set up for hacker then we'll delve into the following topics. Hacking Lab ¨C In this section we will set up our own lab where we can carry out attacks (you will be able to use your Mac, Windows, Linux operating systems, donĄŻt worry!). This lab is essentially a virtual machine that we will use to hack (Kali Linux), throughout the course we also set up additional virtual *vulnerable machines* on which we can practice our attacks . The reason we use virtual machines is that we are not allowed to test our attacks on real life websites and networks, so we create our own environment to do this. Download Virtual Box and Kali Linux Setting up our first virtual machine Install Kali Linux operating system 5 stages of penetration testing Navigating the Kali Linux system Create files and manage directories Master network commands and Sudo permissions in Kali Optional: PYTHON 101 ¨C Learn Python 3 programming from scratch. This part is not mandatory, it is optional for those who want to learn programming so that you can build your own hacker tools! Learn Python basics Learn Python Intermediate Learning Python: Error Handling Learning Python: File Input and Output Reconnaissance ¨C Here we study what is called Ą°footprintsĄą, or in other words, information gathering. Once we have selected a target, our first task is to obtain as much information about the target as possible What is information collection? Use the Whois tool to obtain IP addresses and entity addresses Whatweb Stealth Scan Offensive Website Techniques Discovery IP Ranges Collect emails using Harvester and Hunterio How to download tools online Use Sherlock to find usernames BONUS ¨C Email scraping tool in Python 3 More on information gathering Scan ¨C This is where things get real. In this section we also collect information, but we try to only collect technical information (e.g. if they have open ports, if they have a firewall, what software are they running on those open ports, what operating system do they have, are they an outdated operating system, etc.) The theory behind scanning TCP and UDP Installing a vulnerable virtual machine network probing Perform the first Nmap scan Different Nmap scan types Discover the target operating system Detect the version of a service executing on an open port Filter port range and output of scan results What is a firewall/IDS? Using decoys and packet fragmentation Safe circumvention of Nmap options NOTE: It's time to change things up! Python Coding Project ¨C Port Scanner Vulnerability Analysis ¨C In this part, we use information gathered from the scan (such as the software the target is executing on an open port). Using this information, we try to determine if there are any known vulnerabilities. Find the first vulnerability using Nmap scripts Manual vulnerability analysis and Searchsploit Install Nessus Discover vulnerabilities with Nessus Scan Windows 7 machines with Nessus Exploitation (??EXPLOITATION??)?and taking permission ¨C this is the exciting part of the course. This is where we attack and gain entry into the target machine. In this section we will cover many different vulnerabilities and different targets. We conduct these attacks on virtual machines and cover another very important tool for hackers: the Metasploit framework. The goal of exploitation is to gain access to that target machine. This means we have to drop a payload on the target machine so that we can use it to browse their system, view their files, execute anything we want, and delete anything we want, while the target machine Don't know anything about it. We will also learn to create our own viruses and trojans, delivered to targets via email or USB What is exploitation? What is a vulnerability? Reverse shell, tie-down shellĄ­ Metasploit framework structure Basic commands of Msfconsole Our first vulnerability ¨C vsftp 2.3.4 vulnerability Misconfiguration Occurrences ¨C Development of Tie Shells Information Disclosure ¨C Telnet Vulnerability Software Vulnerability ¨C Samba Vulnerability Attacking SSH ¨C Brute Force Attack Challenges of Exploitation ¨C 5 Different Methods of Exploitation Explaining Windows 7 settings Attack Ą°Eternal BlueĄą ¨C Windows 7 exploit Exploiting the DoublePulsar¨CWindows vulnerability Blue Light Vulnerability ¨C Windows Exploit Router vulnerabilities Router default credentials Setting up a vulnerable Windows 11 Remotely crashes Windows 11 machine Exploiting Windows 11 machines remotely Generate basic payload with Msfvenom Get more information Generate Powershell payload using Veil TheFatRat payload build Hexeditor & Antiviruses Let our payload open an image file Post-exploitation ¨C This is what comes after exploitation. Post-exploitation is what we do on a target machine after we have exploited it. Since we're on that machine, we can do a lot of things, depending on what we want to get from it. Finally, after we've done everything we want to do, we want to make sure to cover our tracks by deleting any event logs or deleting any evidence that we were ever on that machine late exploitation theory Basic commands of the metrological interpreter Increase permissions with different mods Establish resiliency on the target system Post-exploitation module Python Coding Project ¨C Backdoor Website Penetration Testing ¨C This is another big topic in hacker. In this section, we are focusing on websites and their bugs/vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be anything from misconfiguration, SQL injection (where we interact with the database), information disclosure (erroneously accessing some information that shouldn't be there), command injection (interacting with the system directly through a web page), XSS ( Cross-site scripting attacks and injecting Javascript code on the page) Website Penetration Testing Theory HTTP requests and responses Information collection and Dirb tools Vulnerability configuration Exploitation of ShellShock vulnerability Utilization of command injection Obtain Meterpreter shell through command execution Reflected XSS and Cookie Theft Stored XSS HTML injection SQL injection CSRF vulnerability Hydra brute force attack Burpsuite intruder Python coding project ¨C brute force login + directory discovery Man-in-the-Middle ¨C This is an attack used inside the network. This allows us to sniff any unencrypted material and see it in plain text. This may also include seeing plain text passwords for some websites. There are many tools that can perform this attack for us, we introduce some of the main ones in this section Theory ¨C Man-in-the-Middle Attack Bettercap ARP Spoofing Ettercap password sniffing Manually poison target ARP cache with Scapy WIFI Crack ¨C This section is where we want to gain access to the network by cracking the WiFi password Wifi cracking theory Put wireless card into monitor mode De-authentication of device and get password Aircrack password cracking Hashcat password cracking Social Engineering ¨C This is something we cover in almost every section. Social engineering is an attack on humanity because we know that humans are always the weakest security! +More more!

This means we have to drop a payload on the target machine so that we can use it to browse their system, view their files, execute anything we want, and delete anything we want, while the target machine Don't know anything about it. We will also learn to create our own viruses and trojans, delivered to targets via email or USB\n             </strong>\n            </li>\n            <strong>\n             <img height=\"300\" src=\"/training/hk_files/framework.png\" width=\"520\"/>\n            </strong>\n           </ol>\n           <ul>\n            <li>\n             What is exploitation?\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             What is a vulnerability?\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Reverse shell, tie-down shellĄ­\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Metasploit framework structure\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Basic commands of Msfconsole\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Our first vulnerability ¨C vsftp 2.3.4 vulnerability\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Misconfiguration Occurrences ¨C Development of Tie Shells\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Information Disclosure ¨C Telnet Vulnerability\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Software Vulnerability ¨C Samba Vulnerability\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Attacking SSH ¨C Brute Force Attack\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Challenges of Exploitation ¨C 5 Different Methods of Exploitation\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Explaining Windows 7 settings\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Attack Ą°Eternal BlueĄą ¨C Windows 7 exploit\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Exploiting the DoublePulsar¨CWindows vulnerability\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Blue Light Vulnerability ¨C Windows Exploit\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Router vulnerabilities\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Router default credentials\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Setting up a vulnerable Windows 11\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Remotely crashes Windows 11 machine\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Exploiting Windows 11 machines remotely\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Generate basic payload with Msfvenom\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Get more information\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Generate Powershell payload using Veil\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             TheFatRat payload build\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Hexeditor &amp; Antiviruses\n            </li>\n            <li>\n             Let our payload open an image file\n            </li>\n           </ul>\n           <ol start=\"7\">\n            <li>\n             <strong>\n              Post-exploitation ¨C This is what comes after exploitation.
