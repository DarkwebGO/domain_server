The Payment methods and transaction processs we accept are Bitcoin Or Monero, If you have never used Bitcoin or Monero before and donâ€™t know how it works, you can read a guide where we explain the whole process step by step. To read it, click on the following link:How to pay with Bitcoin or Monero Cancel an order Once an order has been placed, it won't be possible to cancel it. If you're not sure if you really want the service, then don't order anything yet. Don't act impulsively and irresponsibly. Relax and think if you really want it. No one is forcing you to place an order. If you do, it will be of your own free will, and you can't repent later. There is no deadline for regret. There have been people who write to us after a few minutes of placing an order and consider that the short time that has elapsed is a valid reason to cancel it. It doesn't matter if you placed your order just a second ago, you can't cancel it anyway. Instead of placing an order and regret after a few minutes, better take those minutes to think before acting. This rule also applies to modifications. Double check the information you send us and make sure it is correct. If you make a mistake, that is going to be your problem, and you'll have to pay for it anyway. Last details If you want to hire this service for two or more students, ask us for discounts. If you have any questions, ask them before placing an order, not after. If you want to place an order as an intermediary, that is, on behalf of another person, please ask us for special conditions. I want to place an order! Please, make sure you have read everything before requesting a hacking service. If you have questions or don't understand something, ask all your questions before placing an order. If you have read, understood, and accept our service agreement completely and want to place an order, send a message to our email: shadowhacker@tuta.io[email protected] containing all the following 5 points that we mention below: Tell us that you want to hire our Academic Hacking service. Confirm that you read the Service Agreement and that you agree with everything and have no doubts. The URL of your college from where you login to see your grades or academic record. Your username and password, or whatever data is necessary to log in to your student area from where we can see your grades or academic record. Tell us very accurately and clearly to avoid confusion what exactly you want to do, what is the grade you want to change, or what is the subject you want to add or delete. Whatever you want to do, explain us clearly. After receiving your message, we'll reply to confirm the start of your order. Remember that once an order has been placed, there is no way to cancel or modify it.
