We will handle relevant business in a timely manner.Email: shadowhacker@tuta.ioï¼ŒIf you want to encrypt your message, here is our pgp public keyï¼š As soon as your order is received, we'll reply to you to confirm that we've already started working on it, and we'll give you an order number with which you can track the status of your order in real time through this link: My Order. The Payment methods and transaction processs we accept are Bitcoin Or Monero, If you have never used Bitcoin or Monero before and donâ€™t know how it works, you can read a guide where we explain the whole process step by step. To read it, click on the following link:How to pay with Bitcoin or Monero How it works? In theory, just with an IP address it is not possible to know who the person behind it is, but it is an important clue to find it out. An IP address by itself doesn't store any personal information because it doesn't belong to a person but to a company: the internet provider (with whom the person who has used that IP address has contracted their internet service). We can easily determine who is the internet provider of the IP address that you want to trace and hack their database in order to know which of all their customers has used it. By doing this, we can obtain all the data of the person behind the IP address, such as: Fullname. Home address. Phone number. ID number and perhaps a scanned copy as well. Don't know the IP Many people contact us because they want to trace down someone whose IP address they don't know. For example, someone who has created a social network account for impersonating them, or who has sent threatening messages, cyber bullied or harassed from fake accounts. If you don't know what the IP address of the person you want to trace is, it is still possible to do the service, but it will be necessary to hire another service before so you can find out what the IP address is, and only after discovering the IP address, it will be possible run this service for tracing it. It will be possible to find out an IP address through an email or social network account. For example: if you received messages from a fake Facebook account, we can hack that Facebook account to verify in the access logs what the IP address was used to access it. If this is your case, tell us what information you have about the person you want to track, specifically if you know of any email address or social network account that such person has used. Cancel an order Once an order has been placed, it won't be possible to cancel it. If you're not sure if you really want the service, then don't order anything yet. Don't act impulsively and irresponsibly. Relax and think if you really want it. No one is forcing you to place an order. If you do, it will be of your own free will, and you can't repent later. There is no deadline for regret. There have been people who write to us after a few minutes of placing an order and consider that the short time that has elapsed is a valid reason to cancel it. It doesn't matter if you placed your order just a second ago, you can't cancel it anyway. Instead of placing an order and regret after a few minutes, better take those minutes to think before acting. This rule also applies to modifications. Double check the information and make sure you send us the correct one. If you make a mistake, that is going to be your problem, and you'll have to pay for it anyway. Last details If you want to hack two or more IP addresses, ask us for discounts. If you have any questions, ask them before placing an order, not after. If you want to place an order as an intermediary, that is, on behalf of another person, please ask us for special conditions. I want to place an order! Please, make sure you have read everything before requesting a hacking service. If you have questions or don't understand something, ask all your questions before placing an order. If you have read, understood, and accept our service agreement completely and want to place an order, send a message to our email: shadowhacker@tuta.io[email protected] containing all the following 3 points that we mention below: Tell us that you want to hire an IP Tracking service. Confirm that you read the Service Agreement and that you agree with everything and have no doubts. The IP address that you want to trace. If you don't know it, tell us what information you know about the person you want to trace. After receiving your message, we'll reply to confirm the start of your order. Remember that once an order has been placed, there is no way to cancel or modify it.

We can easily determine who is the internet provider of the IP address that you want to trace and hack their database in order to know\n    <strong>\n     which of all their customers has used it\n    </strong>\n    . By doing this, we can obtain all the data of the person behind the IP address, such as:\n   </p>\n   <ul class=\"list-with-padding align-icons\">\n    <li>\n     <i class=\"fas fa-user\">\n     </i>\n     Fullname.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <i class=\"fas fa-home\">\n     </i>\n     Home address.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <i class=\"fas fa-mobile\">\n     </i>\n     Phone number.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     <i class=\"fas fa-id-card\">\n     </i>\n     ID number and perhaps a scanned copy as well.\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"wp_point\">\n  <div class=\"title\">\n   <i class=\"fas fa-ban\">\n   </i>\n   <span>\n    Don't know the IP\n   </span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"wp-content\">\n   <p>\n    Many people contact us because they want to trace down someone whose IP address\n    <strong>\n     they don't know\n    </strong>\n    . For example, someone who has created a social network account for impersonating them, or who has sent threatening messages, cyber bullied or harassed from fake accounts. If you don't know what the IP address of the person you want to trace is, it is still possible to do the service, but it will be necessary to hire another service before so you can\n    <strong>\n     find out what the IP address is\n    </strong>\n    , and only after discovering the IP address, it will be possible run this service for tracing it.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    It will be possible to find out an IP address\n    <strong>\n     through an email or social network account\n    </strong>\n    .
