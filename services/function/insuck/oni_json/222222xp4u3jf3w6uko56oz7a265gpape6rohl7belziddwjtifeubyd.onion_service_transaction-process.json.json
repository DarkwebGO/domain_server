We ensure the job is completed on time, correctly and everything is executed as originally agreed.The following article will guide you through the entire process of hacking services: 1 Initial Contact: To contact us, please use an email provider that is as secure as possible. I don't recommend using popular email providers for contact (such as Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail); instead, I recommend opening a new account using Tuta or ProtonMail. If you want to encrypt your message, This is our PGP public key:Click here to enter When you contact us - explain the services required in as much detail as possible to avoid confusion, Vague or irrelevant messages will be deleted; if you want a reply, please take it seriously. 2 Follow-up: Within a few hours, a handler should get back to you. The handler's first priority is to see that you are serious and that your request is feasible. They will also answer any questions you may have. Once the due diligence is complete, we move on to the next step. 3 Quotes and Time of Service: We will reply by email based on the difficulty of the customer's consultation business, explaining the required fees and the time required to complete it. After the customer agrees, just reply to the email to agree to the transaction. After we receive the email, you can pay directly online. There will be a Bitcoin payment link behind each business. You can pay directly, or ask us for a Bitcoin or Monero payment address (each customer will be assigned a Brand new virtual currency payment address, the address will be destroyed after the transaction, so privacy is safe), please include the handling fee. After the transfer is successful, a screenshot will be sent to our email. Once the payment is verified, the handler will reply to the email and give the customer an order number. The order number generated based on the order can be used for later inquiries, maintenance, upgrades, etc. After the work task is completed, we will notify the customer via email as soon as possible. 4 Note: Please do not interfere with or interact with the target through technical or other means. Anything that raises suspicion could jeopardize the job. This includes, but is not limited to, posting relevant content, mocking the target, or persistently logging into the target server. Your handler will always keep you fully informed. 5 Conclusion: Once we have completed our work, we will provide you with all the information for your review. Once you verify and confirm the results, we complete all handovers immediately. 6 Data Purge: Once we've completed our work, all information about you, your goals, and tasks will be securely deleted from our servers.
