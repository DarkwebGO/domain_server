We will handle relevant business in a timely manner.Email: shadowhacker@tuta.ioï¼ŒIf you want to encrypt your message, here is our pgp public keyï¼š As soon as your order is received, we'll reply to you to confirm that we've already started working on it, and we'll give you an order number with which you can track the status of your order in real time through this link: My Order. The Payment methods and transaction processs we accept are Bitcoin Or Monero, If you have never used Bitcoin or Monero before and donâ€™t know how it works, you can read a guide where we explain the whole process step by step. To read it, click on the following link:How to pay with Bitcoin or Monero Knowledge This is not a hacking service intended for novices or amateurs. After we hack a website and get its administration credentials, the access and administration of the web server is made through console, by executing SSH commands. If you don't have technical knowledge, you'll receive the administration data from the website but you won't know what to do with it or how to login. Many people expect to find a nice control panel with options and menus to click on. If this is what you expect, then you are wrong. The service we offer is to hack a web server completely, not a specific login form from a random page but the server itself. Knowledge of SSH is requiredï¼ŒIf you donâ€™t know the basic knowledge of website management permissions, we can simply teach you how to operate and use it. Cancel an order Once an order has been placed, it won't be possible to cancel it. If you're not sure if you really want the service, then don't order anything yet. Don't act impulsively and irresponsibly. Relax and think if you really want it. No one is forcing you to place an order. If you do, it will be of your own free will, and you can't repent later. There is no deadline for regret. There have been people who write to us after a few minutes of placing an order and consider that the short time that has elapsed is a valid reason to cancel it. It doesn't matter if you placed your order just a second ago, you can't cancel it anyway. Instead of placing an order and regret after a few minutes, better take those minutes to think before acting. This rule also applies to modifications. Double check the information and make sure you send us the correct one. If you make a mistake, that is going to be your problem, and you'll have to pay for it anyway. Last details We'll get the original administrator credentials. The one that is being currently used. We won't change anything. Along with the credentials, we'll send you a free PDF document with some instructions and suggestions so that you can enter the web server with security and discretion. You will have a 15-day guarantee. If the administrator password changes within this time after delivery, you only have to notify us and we'll get it again for free. If you want to hack two or more websites, ask us for discounts. If you have any questions, ask them before placing an order, not after. If you want to place an order as an intermediary, that is, on behalf of another person, please ask us for special conditions. I want to place an order! Please, make sure you have read everything before requesting a hacking service. If you have questions or don't understand something, ask all your questions before placing an order. If you have read, understood, and accept our service agreement completely and want to place an order, send a message to our email: shadowhacker@tuta.io[email protected] containing all the following 3 points that we mention below: Tell us that you want to hire a Website Hacking service. Confirm that you read the Service Agreement and that you agree with everything and have no doubts. The URL or IP address of the website that you want to hack. After receiving your message, we'll reply to confirm the start of your order. Remember that once an order has been placed, there is no way to cancel or modify it.

Many people expect to find a nice control panel with options and menus to click on. If this is what you expect, then you are wrong.
