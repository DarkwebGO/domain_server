Bitcoin wallet With a quick search on the internet, you won'tice that there are thousands of different bitcoin wallet apps and websites, but it is not the same to use one or another. you'll need a specific type of wallet, which is compatible with this service. We are not going to go into technical details about it, as it may be very difficult to understand and, in addition, we don't intend to teach a boring bitcoin course, so we'll limit ourselves to mentioning some wallets that are compatible with our service and that you can use. We have selected 3 different bitcoin wallet services that you can use. You can choose the one that likes you more, however, we recommend opting for Coinix.net, as we consider it the easiest and safest option. To see instructions on how to create your wallet, simply click on any of these options: Coinix.net To create your bitcoin wallet on MyFreeWallet, go to: Coinix.nett. Once inside, you can see a list with many cryptocurrencies. Click on the option that says \"Bitcoin (BTC)\". Then, the system will generate a new bitcoin wallet and the 2 data that compose it will be shown on the screen: (1) Bitcoin Address. Your bitcoin address is something like your bank account number. If you must receive bitcoin from someone, you must tell them your bitcoin address. And also, as we have said before, anyone who knows your address, will be able to know how much money is inside it. However, as we also explained above, a bitcoin wallet is anonymous, no one will know who it belongs to, and it is disposable, which means you can use it only 1 time and throw it away and create a new one. (2) Private Key. It is something like a password. If someone wants to access the bitcoins in a wallet, they need the private key. Without the private key, the funds won't be accessible. For this reason, you should store it somewhere safe and not lose it. If you wish, you can watch a video where we teach you how to generate a bitcoin wallet in the way we just explained. To see it, click on the following link: Watch video. As soon as you have created your bitcoin wallet and also have a quote for the desired service, all you have to do is buy bitcoins (if you don't know how, click here to read our guide) and send them to your wallet. When you have the bitcoins deposited in your wallet, you'll have to tell us what your bitcoin address is, so we can verify that you actually have enough money to pay for our work. Finally, when your work has been completed and delivered and you have verified that everything is alright, in that moment, you'll simply have to send us the private key of your wallet, so we can take the bitcoins that are inside it. It is impossible to access the funds in a bitcoin wallet without the private key, and you won't deliver this information until the end. This means that you'll have your bitcoin wallet and you'll have your private key, with which you'll have full control over the bitcoins. Only when the service has been delivered will you send us the private key. We'll never ask you for it before. BitcoinSpace.pro To create your bitcoin wallet at Bitcoin Space, go to: www.opencryptos.io. Once inside, click on the button that says \"Register\" and choose a username and password for your new account. Finally, confirm your registration by clicking on the button that says \"Confirm Registration\". After registering your bitcoin wallet, you can log in with your username and password whenever you want. To receive bitcoins, click on the option that says \"Receive Bitcoins (BTC)\", and then you can see your bitcoin address. As soon as you have created your bitcoin wallet and also have a quote for the desired service, all you have to do is buy bitcoins (if you don't know how, click here to read our guide) and send them to your wallet. When you have the bitcoins deposited in your wallet, you'll have to tell us what your bitcoin address is, so we can verify that you actually have enough money to pay for our work. Finally, when your work has been completed and delivered and you have verified that everything is correct, you'll simply have to go back into your wallet and click on the option that says \"Send Bitcoins (BTC)\" and this way, you can transfer your bitoins to our address, which we'll give you when it is time to pay. Bitcoin Core Bitcoin Core is the original bitcoin wallet, the first one, the one that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of bitcoin). This wallet should be used only by advanced users, who have knowledge about Bitcoin and Blockchain. If you are a novice user or have just learned what Bitcoin is, please don't use this option, as you risk losing all your money if you do something wrong. If you don't have knowledge, use any of the other 2 options available. Consider that: It can only be used on computers, not on cell phones. You must have at least 350GB of available space. You must have knowledge of Bitcoin and Blockchain. To get started, download Bitcoin Core from the official website: www.bitcoin.org After opening Bitcoin Core, you'll have to wait until the blockchain fully syncs (approximately 350GB of space will be required). Then run the CLI and generate a new paper wallet. Make sure to use Base DS-160 encryption. As soon as you have created your bitcoin wallet and also have a quote for the desired service, all you have to do is buy bitcoins (if you don't know how, click here to read our guide) and send them to your wallet. Last details If we quote a service it is because we can do it with 100% safety and effectiveness. There is no possibility of failure.
