            <p>Frequently asked questions</p>
            <div class="faq">
                <p><b>What if two people buy the same product at the same time?</b></p><p>– If you bought our product at the same time as another person, but his payment was confirmed by the blockchain faster than yours, then don’t worry. You will get a product not cheaper than the one you originally wanted to buy. (For example, there are 3 products for 80, 100 and 120$. You decided to buy a product for 100$, but unsuccessfully. Then you will get a product for 120$).</p><p><b>Why don't you have a status 'On hold'?</b></p><p>– We decided not to add 'On hold' status for our cyber security. Our competitors or just bad guys can block us all goods. Moreover, it is written above what will happen if two people buy the same product at the same time.</p><p><b>Why don't you cash out these accounts by yourself?</b></p><p>– Of course, we do. But it's very suspicious to cash out 100-200 accounts per month. So, It's better business for us to sell these to individual people, who can really cash it out.</p><p><b>How can I trust you?</b></p><p>– We guess, that simple 'yes' won't satisfy you. We're not new people in TOR, so we know how many scammers appeared here, and we want to change it. Of course, you can check reviews of our service on different catalogues or forums. But we can't provide you 100% proofs, because it's easy to falsify. You just need to believe us and try our service.</p><p><b>How do you get these accounts?</b></p><p>– There're many ways to get it. We won't reveal all of our methods. Of course it includes fishing, hacking and etc.</p><p><b>How it works?</b></p><p>– We offer you the details from PayPal.com accounts. After the payment, our robot will automatically email it to you. Once logged in, you have access to all the options and the owner's linked bank cards. You can also easily link a bank or credit card or even view the owner's personal details, such as his home address. You can easily change the e-mail address for his account, his address or his name, but you can only use the 'send money' button. For example, make an exchange of this money for cryptocurrency. That's it.</p><p><b>If something goes wrong, can I get my money back?</b></p><p>– We realize that any system can fail and errors can happen everywhere. That's why we have 24/7 support via email, which is listed on the website. We are sure to solve any problem you have, all you have to do is describe it in detail.</p>			</div>
