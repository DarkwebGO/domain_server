                <a href="">Obama vs. Russia (in Ukraine) I</a>
            </h1>
        </header><p>The actual beginning of the road to war occurred soon after 8 February 2010, when the reputed Britain’s Guardian newspaper headlined “Yanukovych set to become president as observers say Ukraine election was fair”. Viktor Yanukovich was a pro-Russian.</p>
<p>On 2 April 2010, Gallup (the standard U.S. Government contractor to poll Ukrainians) headlined “Ukrainians Likely Support Move Away From NATO: Residents more likely to view NATO as a threat than protection,” and reported that 40% saw NATO as “Threat,” while 17% saw it as “Protection.” Ukrainians definitely viewed America as being a hostile power. They were basically pro-Russia.</p>
<p>Ten days later, the democratically elected President V. Yanukovych was invited by the US President, Barack Obama. The American side was represented by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, national security advisor to the U.S. President James Jones, senior director of the U.S. National Security Council on non-proliferation Laura Holgate.There the Ukrainian refused Obama’s suggestions that Ukraine joined NATO against Russia.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Americans would not surrender that quick. On 2 July 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Yanukovych held a joint press conference in Kiev, where she said: “We discussed ways that Ukraine and the United States can deepen and expand our strategic partnership, moving forward with the work of the U.S.-Ukraine Strategic Partnership Commission that I co-chair. … And the United States welcomes Ukrainian parliament’s decision to approve foreign military exercises on Ukrainian territory in 2010 and we thank Ukraine and the Ukrainian people for your important contributions to NATO and other international security operations. … And as I said, we are grateful for Ukraine’s contributions to NATO security efforts and other peacekeeping operations around the world. And we look forward to the joint U.S.-Ukraine military exercises. And we also support a relationship with Russia that is in Ukraine’s interest that helps to further what President Obama has called the resetting of relations with Russia.”</p>
<p>A “resetting of relations with Russia”, this is certainly the key motive of Hillary Clinton’s Commission. This has to be understood from the stand point of attracting Ukraine into the Western orbit with the natural consequence of NATO expansion towards the same borders of Russia. Obama was preparing the Cuba’62 version 2.0, the year when President Kennedy saw the enemy at his gates when Soviet Premier, Khrushchev deployed Nuclear missiles in Cuban soil aiming to the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Similarly the EU approached this ex-Soviet Union territory as it saw the seceded country as a good new market of 44 million inhabitants with strategic resources, agriculture and raw materials. </p>
<p>Russia raised the alerts and manoeuvred against this new geopolitical and strategic scenario. Yanukovych, nevertheless turned down this alliance against Russia, the proposal that Ukraine joined the EU and abandon its trade with Russia, as these were essential prerequisites to joining the US-led military bloc and accepting to deploy nuclear weapons right by Russia’s border. </p>
<p>This declining was stated in the Western mainstream media as being that Yanukovich was allied with Russia against America. This breaking news sounded threatening, but the actual reason was that America and its EU had set the deal up for Ukraine to bleed $160 billion which it simply didn’t have. It was just a set-up to stir “peaceful Maidan demonstrations” against Yanukovych, a pretext for a CIA sponsored coup d’etat. The objective, obviously, was to install an anti-Russian Government in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration’s planning for the coup d’etat to regime-change Ukraine started in 2011 after Yanukovych had turned down Hillary Clinton’s proposals, which was to join the West against Russia. It was planned on the basis that Yanukovych would turn the EU’s offer to Ukraine down, a very predictable course of action of the  pro-Pussian government. And so Yanukovych did that on the 20th of November 2013. </p>
<p>But the plan was outlined two years before.The U.S. regime under Barack Obama had been planning, since June 2011, the takeover of Ukraine, in order to become enabled ultimately to place its nuclear missiles within less than five minutes flying-time to a first-strike blitz destruction of the Kremlin (thus preventing any effective Russian counter-attack). However, things didn’t work out quite according to the plan for the takeover and here is how the war in Ukraine actually began:</p>
<p>The ‘Ukrainian revolution’ (actually an orchestrated coup, as we are insisting) started the day after. It was initiated by the demonstrations on the Maidan Square in Kiev, and they began on the night of 21 November 2013 with public protests in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kiev. As part of the plot, the CIA unleashed the Banderites (see previous post).</p>
<p>Not only Ukrainians were participating in these dramatic events but also hired foreigners with the purpose of igniting the masses. Violent clashes started, snipers out of the blue started shooting randomly to create chaos and fury. The Banderites, who at last saw a chance to seize the power and carry out their ultranationalistic ideals about he creation of a pure racial state, which was focused against different ethnics especially Russians, took the streets to display their true colours, and showed openly the real nature of their movement, rooted unquestionably in the fascist and national-socialism political premises. Three different actors had converging plans in Ukraine: The EU would expand its markets, the US would carry on with the weakening of Russia and the Banderites would establish their long dreamed pure racial state. Their enemies? In the first place Russians, but at a convenient time in the future Jews, Poles and other ethnics.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama (via his State Department official Victoria Nuland, and Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt) relied chiefly upon Andrei Parubiy (“the Commandant of Maidan”) to be in charge of the Ukrainian coup in February 2014, and upon Dmitriy Yarosh to be his lieutenant. Yarosh subsequently emerged to be the Executive Officer of Ukraine’s “ATO” or ‘Anti Terrorist Operation,’ the Government’s operation to eliminate the residents in the areas of Ukraine that had voted 90%+ for the man whom Obama’s coup overthrew: Ukraine’s democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych. (If those residents were to vote in future Ukrainian national elections, then a Ukrainian leader like Yanukovych could easily be elected again; so, eliminating the residents in those areas was essential in order to make Obama’s coup stick.) Yarosh was not only the enforcer during the coup itself, but he became the enforcer in its essential follow-through, the “ATO.” (It’s known also as the war against Donbass, or Ukraine’s civil war, among other names or titles of reference.)</p>
