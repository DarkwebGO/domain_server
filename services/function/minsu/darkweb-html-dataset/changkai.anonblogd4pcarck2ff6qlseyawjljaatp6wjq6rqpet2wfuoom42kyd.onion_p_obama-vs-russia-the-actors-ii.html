            </h1>
        </header><p>The so-called “Orange revolution&quot; has to be truly referred as a coup d’etat. This coup was organized by the U.S. Government, as we are seeing in the previous posts. Before the Russian start of the Special Military Operation on February 24, 2022, a new Cold War was reactivated by the U.S. Government with sanctions and an attempt to bring NATO nuclear capability into the Ukraine in 2014, especially after Russian’s annexation of Crimea. They call it now HYBRID WAR.</p>
<p>In spite of all that Russia’s Government reacted to America’s strategies, which aimed to place nuclear devices in the Ukraine (less than 5 minutes flight-time to Moscow). By doing so the nuclear balance would definitely be tilted towards the West, keeping the Russian nation captive to the will of the West. The dismemberment of the Russian state is a must in order to isolate and control China’s rise. As we have already mentioned in the previous posts, during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, America had reasons to fear Soviet nuclear missiles deployed 103 miles from America’s border. But, after America’s Ukrainian coup in 2014, Russia had the same reasons to fear NATO nuclear rockets not just near, but right at Putin’s borders. And consequently by kidnapping Russia’s sovereignty, the next move in the geopolitical chess game would be the dismemberment of Russia and press China from the west. </p>
<p>But first things first. Who were the engineers of the taking over of the Ukraine? Let us review the key figures:</p>
<p>Victoria Nuland</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama’s agent overseeing the coup, at least during the month of February 2014. Her intervention was paramount not only in overthrowing the existing Ukrainian Government (legally elected), but in installing its rabidly anti-Russian replacement. It was the second time after Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich invasion of the USSR (Operation “Barbarossa”) when the Banderites saw a chance to carry out their plans for the constitution of a racially pure Ukrainian state. It was not enough for them having an internationally recognised state, it had to be ethnically pure according to Stepan Bandera’s ideals. And for Nuland, the Banderites and the US were the perfect allies to support her anti-Russian strategies. Converging interests, so to speak. </p>
<p>On January 27, 2014 in a phone-conversation between her and North America’s Ambassador in Ukraine, Jeffrey Pyatt, the guidelines emanated from the Obama’s administration were expressed in all its significance. Nuland there and then abandoned the EU’s hope for a still democratic but less corrupt future government for Ukraine, and Nuland famously said, on that call “Fuck the EU,” and she instructed Pyatt to choose instead the paranoid anti-Russian, and far-right, Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Let us not forget that this occurred 24 days before Ukraine’s President Victor Yanukovych was overthrown, and 30 days before the new person to head Ukraine’s Government, Yatsenyuk, became officially appointed to rule the now clearly fascist country. He won that official designation on February 26. However, this was only a formality: Obama’s agent had already chosen him, on January 27. She in turn was appointed by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who were appointed by Barack Obama (the actual mastermind of the post-Maidan Ukraine).</p>
<p>Jeffrey Pyatt</p>
<p>The host in the Ukraine as we have seen, was the US ambassador in Kiev. As early as on March 1, 2013, he supported the implementation of Obama’s plan: the first “tech camp” to train far-right Ukrainians on how to organize online the mass-demonstrations against Yanukovych, was held inside the U.S. Embassy in Kiev on that date, which was over nine months before the Maidan demonstrations to overthrow Ukraine’s democratically elected President started, on November 20, 2013.</p>
<p>Arseniy Yatsenyuk (Yats). </p>
<p>In the famous leaked telephone call between Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, J. Pyatt, they discussed who was to be the next prime minister of Ukraine. Nuland’s choice was Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a die-hard anti-Russian politician. Nuland famously said: ‘I think Yats is the guy.’ When Pyatt warned Nuland that the Europeans might not support Yatsenyuk, Nuland bluntly replied: ‘Fuck the EU!’ . Consequently “Yats&quot; ended up as the prime minister of Ukraine following the 2014 coup d’etat that removed Viktor Yanukovych from the office. On April 14, 2016, Yatsenyuk was replaced by a new Prime Minister, Volodymyr Groysman. Yatsenyuk was then proposed as the new head of the Security Service of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Dmitriy Yarosh. </p>
<p>Much has been said about the “mysterious” snipers who showed up during the Maidan turmoil. They indiscriminately shot the different sides during the tragic events in order to create confusion and intensify the clashes. Many of them have been identified so far, being some foreigners and some Ukrainian nationals. Let us remember that they started firing at the police forces and crowds in order to provoke a harsh clashes between them and create chaos and rage. Shortly before the coup, the CIA secretly trained in Poland the Right Sector (Pravyj Sektor) founder/leader Dmitriy Yarosh, who headed Ukraine’s snipers. So, even the Ukrainian ones were working ultimately for the U.S.</p>
<p>Dmitriy Yarosh is the founder and head of one of Ukraine’s two nazi-style parties, in this case Pravyj Sektor or Right Sector. He is officially the number 2 Ukrainian national-security official, working directly under Andreiy Paribuyj, who heads Ukraine’s other nazi party (the party that used to call itself Ukraine’s “Social Nationalist Party,” after Hitler’s National Socialist Party, but which the CIA renamed “Svoboda,” (“Freedom”) so as to make it more attractive to the mainstream media.</p>
<p>However, Yarosh turned out to be Ukraine’s actual leader after those events, despite not being officially at the top. His nominal boss, Paribuyj, had been appointed by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who was chosen to be Ukraine’s new leader (Victoria Nuland's choice).</p>
<p>As Yarosh declared in an interview in Newsweek, he has “been training paramilitary troops for almost 25 years,” and his “divisions are constantly growing all over Ukraine, but over 10,000 people for sure.” More recently, in October, a pro-Government Ukrainian site interviewed Yarosh and he mentioned specifically a “DUC,” or Volunteer Ukrainian Corps of fighters. He was then asked “How many soldiers in DUC?” and he answered, “About seven thousand men.” These would be his real military force, by far the biggest private army in Ukraine. So, in his private files are everyone’s individual background and skill-level as a “paramilitary,” or far-right mercenary, and they all respect and obey him as the top man. He was the indispensable person in this new Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yarosh hired only proud far-right mercenaries, who are paid by him from…surprise, surprise… U.S. Government agencies, and from oligarchs such as the worldwide famous “philanthropist&quot; George Soros (via his International Renaissance Fund) and Pierre Omidyar; people whose enormous wealth is matched by their intense hatred of Russians and are also paid directly and indirectly by Ukrainian oligarchs. For instance, especially by the one who actually masterminded the May 2 massacre of Russian-ethnic Ukrainians in Odessa: Obama White House’s friend, the Ukrainian billionaire Ihor Kolomoysky. (Kolomoysky offered $5,000 for every confirmed corpse produced at the May 2 Odessa arson).</p>
<p>Ukraine became heavily polarised mainly between the West and the East or basically between the areas with a majority of nationalist Ukrainians (west) and other ethnics, mainly Russians (east). The civil war was ready to be served; it only needed a spark. And this came when two of the territories that had voted massively for Yanukovych, broke away from the Ukraine: Crimea, and Donbass. Then, the civil war started, citizens against citizens, brothers against brothers, all of them Ukrainians.</p>
