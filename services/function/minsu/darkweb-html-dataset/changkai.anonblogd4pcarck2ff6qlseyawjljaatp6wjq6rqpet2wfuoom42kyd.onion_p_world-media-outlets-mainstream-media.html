            </h1>
        </header><p>&quot;Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes<br />
suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of<br />
misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knowledge with the lies of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>These were the words of President Thomas Jefferson (the third President of <br />
the United States from 1801 - 1809), provides one of the first honest insights into the dishonesty and corruptibility of the media.</p>
<p>Journalism is a honest activity…it is so as long as its goal is just to narrate the truth to the maximum of its capabilities. It does happen with independent bloggers or self-sponsored war-correspondents, who risk their lives in the battlefield along with the warring troops. However even in this case the message transmitted will always contain traces of the personal believes of the narrator, even if he doesn’t want to. But this is expected…it is human.</p>
<p>Nevertheless this is not the case of the MAINSTREAM MEDIA or the great news corporations, the largest information outlets. They are omnipresent and we trust them, because they have been always there...we know their faces, their names and whatever they say catches at least our attention and credit. This way they set the narrative and the narrative does not even need to be truthful, at least in total, because what they pursue is not to make the reader evaluate cold facts and let him extract his own conclusions, but to alter the reader’s emotions and perceptions with an intention. Once this is done the reader will not react rationally anymore but emotionally and it will be an impossible task to convince this individual of the contrary, even presenting the crudest and most undeniable evidences. The only way a human can change his vision over a matter is only through a lengthy research process conducted by himself…and maybe at some point along the way he will start evaluating other “realities” by questioning himself. But in our modern and frantic world who has time for doing this? </p>
<p>The MAINSTREAM MEDIA will publish what they are told to and they will be always biased to benefit the one that extends the checks that pays the salaries. As we referred above, economics is the first engine that drives human action, therefore   these information conglomerates respond always to the needs of the few who control world finances. </p>
<p>There are 3 layers of journalism activity: </p>
<p>a)	Telling half the truth during peace time,<br />
b)	Publishing disinformation, during times of conflict, as this is a weapon in itself, a powerful one that respond to the postulates of Psyops (Psychological Warfare).<br />
c) So, what’s the third? Something that we can call “social-engineering” to the utmost with its direct consequences, what is commonly referred as to MEDIA HYPE. This means to come up with a narrative (normally mixing pieces of reality intermingled with total falsehood, always maliciously) but boasted in all media platforms (TV, Internet, Text Platforms, Radio, any written media, film industry, commercial advertisements…). As the Third Reich’s Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, said “repeat a lie a thousand times and it will become true”.</p>
<p>Hype has shaped the mindsets of millions of Westerners these days (and other cultures), who in their naiveté think they are free individuals, to believe in events that have never happened or atrocities committed by the Russian Army. Everything is being injected in the heads of the citizens and as a consequence a “Russophoby” has started. The level of hatred arisen since the commencement of President Putin’s Special Military Operation is leading the “well informed, refined and educated” Westerners into the believe of the good and the bad, like in a children’s fairy tale.</p>
<p>Such is this social engineering process that many, unwittingly and definitely over excitedly, have even asked for “establishing NO-FLY zone over Ukraine” (not being aware that such a military measure would constitute a casus belli and WWIII) or worse, there are many who are asking already for WWIII. Do they have a clue about what they are asking for? Certainly not.</p>
<p>The so-called 'Free World' under this purposely engineered over excitement has accepted censoring the Russian Media in the West (which in turn was already working on the disinformation level); but not only that, it has started the full cancellation on anything Russian: from sportsmen, to eminent composers, classic writers, other artists, politicians etc. In synthesis, the cancellation of the Russian Culture. Russia is BAD. After all there has been public declarations of American lawmakers vowing for the “physical elimination of Vladimir Putin”. The FREE WORLD has submissively handed in its civil rights due to a collective hysteria. Those who do not stand against Putin are exposed as traitors of the “collective West”, because we are on the “right side of History”. Possibly, to establish a parallelism we have to walk back to the times of the Third Reich when certain literature was published that justified the eradication of the German Volk (People). </p>
<p>In America, John Swinton, then the pre-eminent New York journalist, was the guest of honour at a banquet given him by the leaders of his craft. Someone who knew neither the press nor Swinton offered a toast to the independent press. Swinton outraged his colleagues by replying, &quot;There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. <br />
There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my <br />
occupation would be gone. The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread.</p>
<p>You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.”</p>
<p>&quot;In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, shipbuilding, and powder interest, and their subsidiary organizations, got together twelve men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press... They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers...Anagreement was reached. The policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month, an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies, and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers.”</p>
