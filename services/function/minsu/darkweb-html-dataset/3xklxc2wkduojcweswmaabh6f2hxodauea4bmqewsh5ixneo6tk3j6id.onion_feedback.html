    <div class="comments">Just have to say that I've done my first biz with
        7yearsintibet and I messaged them  that I was breaking some rocks to
        card online. Never recieved any response. After I load few money   on
        this shop email just came with some PRO tips and high balance, working
        CC's. I'm a   bit slow but so far my first purchase with the first card
        was ok 500   usd. I recomend him.</div>

    <div class="comments">7yearsintibet is a top quality vendor. I have
        generated several orders from   him and have never had a bad batch; in
        fact I've  had a larger account a   couple times. Very satisfied, and I
        will continue to order from him. Btw 21 dump street ripped me for my
        money.</div>

    <div class="comments">For those people complaining about minimum order,
        he has a clearly outlined policy on the ordering process and timeframe
        for checking dead cards. <br>
        He   will work with you in that timeframe to get it resolved, and
        resend,   and is legitimate, and will communicate. But you have to not
        be a   dumbass, and follow the guidelines. <br>
        Vendor is legit and reliable. Recommend.</div>

    <div class="comments">Hello, I've fully read your listing and saw that
        there's a minimum   purchase of 5 cards. However, I am asking you to
        sell me one. I would   wait for other seller but he's not going to be in
        business until   next month. If you can hook me up tonight that'd be
        great. Check email.   I'm looking to do more business in the future once
        I experience more of   this.</div>

        I just finished up with my first account, purchased yesterday morning.
        The tutorial is very well written, and the method works 100%. All of
        my   transactions went through without a hitch. It took ~30 hours from
        purchase to me having cash in my hands. AMAZING!<br>
        Thank you, PPCC. I look forward to lots of future business with you. You are performing a wonderful service here! </div>

        service. I've been away for a while and saw majority of the PP seller
        vendors have gone idle. Maybe its due to pizza being away. Anyways, I'm
        just speculating. Don't minde me haha.
