            </h1>
        </header><p>I will have to focus on several approaches to the subject in order to analyze this conflict. It is necessary to do so because many factors intermingle in this “Special Military Operation” (as Russia calls it) and it is very easy to get lost in a myriad of events that are happening literally each day. We will discuss about History, Military, Economics, Politics, Social Issues...</p>
<p>From all of them I consider as the most determining the economic aspects of wars. During Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's invasion of the USSR in June'41, the famous Panzer General Guderian rushed from the Eastern Front to meet Hitler to convince him to retake the halted offensive against Moscow, target which in his opinion was just at the reach of his hand. But the German Leader hesitated and gave a priority to other objectives; this is when he answered to Guderian's assertiveness that generals did not understand the economic aspects of  wars.</p>
<p>In the perfect World human actions that shape the course of History should be the consequence of the sovereign decisions of free individuals (nations), who in turn should define the politics of that particular state that contains them, which consequently would pursue legitimate goals, declare wars or sign peaces; intrinsically these state decisions would need the support of an economic system to facilitate these desired political objectives (politics rule, therefore economics follow). However it is well the opposite. </p>
<p>What is then the first motive of World History? Economics. Nations are subject to politics and these are subject to economics (in simple terms...money rules, politics follow). Perhaps it should not be like this, but so it is. The problem is that in the Western World we think that we are free individuals with the judgement and power emanated from state constitutions that say so and promise us enough to control politics (the Democratic principle of 'the power rests on the People'). Really?</p>
<p>In the first place the gigantic financial conglomerates are supranational organizations in the hands of a few. This has been exacerbated during the years of Globalism. This few don’t know other nations or patriotic feelings rather than the mere monetary profit. There is investment, results need to be obtained and the shareholders are expecting this if possible cutting down costs and maximizing returns. It is not the goal of these lines to identify 'the few'; let us not forget our focus, we are trying to analyze the Ukrainian conflict. I beg you a bit of patience and I will not tell you about who is good or bad, aggressor or victims, ethics or morals. This will be your decision. </p>
<p>But if, at least on the surface, the 'sovereign people' have the power to shape politics how do the financial power influence the citizenship in order to influence policymakers in one or the other direction? Through the largest and most reputable information media outlets. The so-called MAINSTREAM MEDIA is able to feed the mindsets of the readers. This Ukrainian conflict has put in horrible evidence the ability to shape the opinion of millions and this way Western governments will enjoy the back up of the majority of the society to carry on specific actions.Therefore these millions, thinking naively that they are free citizens, will support whatever, identify enemies, impose embargoes or even justify the need to start World War III. In March, just a few weeks into the Special Military Operation that brought the Russian Army into Ukrainian soil, many asked to impose a NO-FLY ZONE over the war zone, most of them ignoring a few delicate and dangerous facts. By definition a no-fly zone which pretends to negate the capability of the adversary to use its air assets (air force), requires patrolling the skies with fully armed combat aircraft after having destroyed surface to air defenses previously. That is a casus belli, an act of war that would have confronted the Russian Federation and NATO with horrendous consequences (nuclear warfare).</p>
<p>But we, humans, do not follow facts and truths, we follow perceptions of the reality that the media carefully present to us with an intention.</p>
