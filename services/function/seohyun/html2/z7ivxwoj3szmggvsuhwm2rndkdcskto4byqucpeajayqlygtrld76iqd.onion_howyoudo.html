        <p style="text-align:left;">You will need to have a good strategy and be very meticulous when you are using several identities, our tutorial will explain exactly how to do, here are some few lines:</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Part 1: Basic Stealth Information for eBay and PayPal </h3>

        <p>With every account, you need to do the following things: <br/>
            1. Different IP <br/>
            2. Different user account on your computer (you can create new ones from the control panel) <br/>
            3. Don’t mix and match different accounts, it will link them together and all will get banned. <br/><br/>
            How to change your IP if you’re in the United States or Canada: <br/>
            To do this, log into your router (if you have a router) at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.0.1
            (depending on your router), and manually change your MAC address (a couple digits is fine), and
            save the settings. Afterwards, turn off your router and your cable modem for 10 minutes and turn
            them back on. Use whatismyip.com to check that your IP address has changed. <br/><br/>
            • Go to whatismyip.com to check your current IP address <br/>
            • Log into your router 		<br/>
            • Change the last 34 digits on your MAC address (should be an option inside the router) <br/>
            • Save changes, and cut the power to your router and your cable modem <br/>
            • Start them up again 10 minutes later <br/>
            • You should have a new IP address now <br/>
            • Check at whatismyip.com to confirm that IP address has changed <br/>
        </p><br/>
        <h3>Part 2: Safety Guide for PayPal</h3>
        <p>How to use PayPal without getting limited <br/>
            If you want to learn how to prevent getting suspended on PayPal, you’re going to have to first
            understand a little bit about how it works. First off, PayPal limits accounts with suspicious or
            “high risk” activity in order to prevent losses. The way it does this is by robots that are trained to
            identify certain behavior – certain triggers cause them to freeze up accounts. </p>

        <p>Now, here’s the thing – they use robots to monitor your accounts. Since there are millions of
            PayPal accounts and thousands of transactions happening at every second, it is very unrealistic
            for them to have a big room of people monitoring every little activity. So these is essentially what
            happens in a nutshell when a limitation occurs. <br/><br/>
            Suspicious activity being done –> Robot picks up on the suspicious activity and triggers
            limitation –> PayPal asks for additional information –> PayPal human employee reviews
            information to reinstate your account or permanently limit it. <br/><br/>
            But here’s the good thing about robots – they’re actually very predictable. If you can learn what
            these triggers limitations, you can avoid them like land mines. So without further delay, let’s start
            learning some of the types of behaviors that cause limitations. <br/><br/>
            Site Owners: Before you attach a new stealth PayPal to your
            website, READ THIS FIRST. <br/><br/>
            If you’ve had a PayPal attached to your website before and it gets limited, PayPal then blacklists
            your domain name from ever using PayPal again. So if you try to attach a new stealth account
            directly to your site, you’ll get banned again. Luckily, there is a solution. <br/><br/>
            Solution: If you use a third party <br/>
            checkout tool that uses PayPal you’ll be able to accept PayPal <br/>
            without fear of being limited. Another thing that you can use is host the checkout on a different
            domain name so that the PayPal doesn’t see it. I’ve seen some people manually..........</p></div>
